# quiz-application
This progrm defines a list of questions, each with a question and four answers to choose from. It then iterates through the questions, asking the user for an answer and comparing it to the correct answer. If the answer is correct, the user's score is incremented. At the end of the quiz, the program prints the user's final score.
